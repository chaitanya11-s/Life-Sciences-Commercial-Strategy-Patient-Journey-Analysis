# Conference Coverage: Oncology Insights (2024-2025)

## Conference 1: ASCO 2024 (American Society of Clinical Oncology)
**Dates:** May 31 – June 4, 2024 | **Location:** Chicago, IL (Hybrid)

### Session 1: Plenary - DESTINY-Breast06 Results
**Topic:** Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in HER2-low and HER2-ultralow metastatic breast cancer.
**Summary:** 
The DESTINY-Breast06 trial results were presented, showing statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) for T-DXd compared to physician's choice of chemotherapy in patients with HER2-low and HER2-ultralow metastatic breast cancer who had received prior endocrine therapy.
**Key Takeaway:** This establishes T-DXd as a new standard of care earlier in the treatment paradigm and expands the "HER2-low" definition to "HER2-ultralow", significantly increasing the addressable patient population.
**Commercial Impact:** Estimated 15-20% increase in eligible patient pool for Enhertu; high urgency for pathologists to adopt lower-limit HER2 scoring.

### Session 2: oral Abstract - NATALEE Update
**Topic:** Ribociclib + NSAI in node-negative, high-risk early breast cancer.
**Summary:**
Updated invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) data continues to support the benefit of adding ribociclib to adjuvant NSAI. The benefit is consistent across subgroups, including node-negative patients with high-risk features.
**Key Takeaway:** Ribociclib differentiates itself from abemaciclib by showing broad efficacy without the need for high Ki-67 scoring requirement in the label.
**Commercial Impact:** Novartis poised to capture significant share of the adjuvant CDK4/6 market; key battleground will be side-effect management (neutropenia vs diarrhea).

### Session 3: Rapid Oral - ADC Mechanisms of Resistance
**Topic:** Understanding resistance to first-generation vs. new-generation ADCs.
**Summary:**
Experts discussed emerging data on Topo-I inhibitor resistance mechanisms. Cross-resistance between Sacituzumab govitecan and T-DXd is a major concern. Sequencing strategies are currently data-poor.
**Key Takeaway:** Developing ADCs with novel payloads (different MoA than Topo-I) is an urgent unmet need.
**Commercial Impact:** Opportunity for pipeline assets with tubulin-inhibitor or DNA-damaging payloads to position themselves as post-T-DXd options.

### Session 4: Clinical Science Symposium - ctDNA Dynamics
**Topic:** Using ctDNA to guide adjuvant therapy escalation/de-escalation.
**Summary:**
Data from multiple small cohorts suggest that ctDNA clearance is a strong predictor of outcome. However, sensitivity remains a challenge for de-escalation decisions.
**Key Takeaway:** ctDNA is not yet ready for prime-time routine clinical decision making in de-escalation, but is increasingly used for risk stratification in trials.
**Commercial Impact:** Diagnostic companies (Guardant, Natera) need to prove clinical utility (impact on survival) not just prognostic value to gain reimbursement.

### Session 5: Education Session - Managing ADC Toxicities
**Topic:** ILD and Ocular Toxicity management.
**Summary:**
Detailed guidelines on monitoring for Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) with T-DXd. Early steroid intervention is critical.
**Key Takeaway:** Safety education is as important as efficacy data for community oncologist adoption.

## Conference 2: ESMO 2024 (European Society for Medical Oncology)
**Dates:** September 13–17, 2024 | **Location:** Barcelona, Spain

### Session 6: Presidential Symposium - KEYNOTE-522 Long-term Follow-up
**Topic:** Pembrolizumab in early TNBC.
**Summary:**
Overall survival (OS) benefit is now statistically significant and clinically meaningful. Event-free survival (EFS) benefit is sustained.
**Key Takeaway:** "Cure" is now a realistic conversation for high-risk TNBC patients. The standard of care is solidified.
**Commercial Impact:** Merck cements dominance in TNBC; high barrier to entry for newcomers in early-stage setting.

### Session 7: Proffered Paper - Oral SERDs Landscape
**Topic:** Comparative efficacy of oral SERDs (Giredestrant, Imlunestrant, etc.) vs Fulvestrant.
**Summary:**
Mixed results across the class. Some assets showing marginal PFS benefits in ESR1-mutated populations, but struggling to beat standard of care in all-comers.
**Key Takeaway:** The "Oral SERD" class is fragmenting. Efficacy is not a class effect but molecule-specific.
**Commercial Impact:** First-to-market advantage (Elacestrant) is significant, but best-in-class efficacy (possibly Giredestrant) could win long-term if data matures well.

### Session 8: Poster Discussion - Novel IO Combinations
**Topic:** LAG-3 and TIGIT combinations in breast cancer.
**Summary:**
Disappointing signals for TIGIT in breast cancer compared to lung. LAG-3 combinations showing some promise in PD-L1 negative tumors but early days.
**Key Takeaway:** IO expansion beyond TNBC remains difficult.

### Session 9: Special Session - AI in Pathology
**Topic:** Digital Pathology for HER2 and ER scoring.
**Summary:**
AI algorithms demonstrated higher consistency in scoring HER2-low and ultralow samples compared to manual pathology.
**Key Takeaway:** AI diagnostic tools will become companion requirements for new ADCs to ensure accurate patient identification.

### Session 10: Late Breaking - Capivasertib CAPItello-291 OS Data
**Topic:** Overall Survival update for Capivasertib in HR+/HER2- advanced BC.
**Summary:**
Trend towards OS benefit observed but not yet fully significant. Benefit clearer in AKT-pathway altered population.
**Key Takeaway:** Testing for AKT/PIK3CA/PTEN alterations is mandatory.
**Commercial Impact:** Testing infrastructure is the bottleneck for uptake.

## Conference 3: SABCS 2024 (San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium)
**Dates:** December 10–14, 2024 | **Location:** San Antonio, TX

### Session 11: General Session 1 - Post-CDK4/6 Options
**Topic:** Sequencing therapies after progression on CDK4/6 inhibitors.
**Summary:**
Real-world evidence suggests "CDK switch" strategies are less effective. PI3K inhibitors and ADCs are the preferred next steps depending on biomarker status.
**Key Takeaway:** The second-line space is becoming crowded and biomarker-driven.
**Commercial Impact:** Clear positioning required for Inavolisib and Capivasertib.

### Session 12: Spotlight - Brain Metastasis
**Topic:** HER2-low ADCs in active brain mets.
**Summary:**
Subgroup analyses show T-DXd has intracranial activity, a major differentiator from chemotherapy.
**Key Takeaway:** CNS activity is a new critical endpoint for all breast cancer drug development.
**Commercial Impact:** Inclusion of brain mets patients in trials is now a competitive necessity.

### Session 13: Controversy Session - "Oligometastatic" Disease
**Topic:** To treat with curative intent or palliative intent?
**Summary:**
Debate on the role of local therapy (surgery/radiation) in de novo stage IV with limited mets. No consensus, but trend towards aggressive local therapy + systemic therapy.

### Session 14: Clinical Science - PROTACs Debut
**Topic:** Phase 3 data from Vepdegestrant.
**Summary:**
Strong PFS data in heavily pre-treated patients. Tolerability profile appears better than oral SERDs (less nausea).
**Key Takeaway:** PROTACs could leapfrog oral SERDs if safety differentiation holds.
**Commercial Impact:** Pfizer/Arvinas collaboration looking strong.

### Session 15: Year in Review
**Summary:**
2024 was the "Year of the ADC". 2025 is predicted to be the "Year of Combinations" (ADC + IO, ADC + TKI).
**Key Takeaway:** Monotherapy limits are being reached; combination toxicity management is the next frontier.
