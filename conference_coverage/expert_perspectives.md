# Expert Perspectives: "Human-Source Elicitation" Synthesis
*Synthesized from simulated interactions with 15+ Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) across ASCO, ESMO, and SABCS.*

## Topic 1: The "HER2-Low" Revolution & Pathologist fatigue
**Dr. Sarah M., Academic Oncologist (USA):**
> "The distinction between HER2-0 and HER2-ultralow is driving our pathologists crazy. Clinically, I want to give T-DXd to anyone who might benefit, but I'm constantly asking for re-staining. We need a binary test: 'ADC-sensitive' vs 'ADC-resistant', rather than this sliding scale of HER2 expression."

**Dr. Hans W., Pathologist (Germany):**
> "We are seeing a 40% increase in request volume for HER2 re-testing on archival tissue. Start-up time for AI-assisted scoring is improving, but reimbursement specifically for AI-reads is non-existent in the EU."

**Insight:** There is a "bottleneck of ambiguity" in pathology that commercial teams must address with education and potentially sponsoring testing vouchers.

## Topic 2: Sequencing in HR+/HER2- Metastatic Setting
**Dr. Elena R., Clinical Investigator (Spain):**
> "After CDK4/6, it’s the Wild West. If they have a PI3K mutation, I go Alpelisib or Inavolisib. If not, I’m increasingly reaching for ADCs (T-DXd or Sacituzumab) earlier, even before chemotherapy. The oral SERDs... frankly, I’m underwhelmed. They are a convenience play, not an efficacy play."

**Dr. Kenji T., KOL (Japan):**
> "In Japan, we are very sensitive to ILD. I am more cautious with T-DXd in the second line. I prefer to exhaust endocrine options with targeted agents (AKT/PI3K inhibitors) before moving to ADCs, unless the disease burden is visceral crisis."

**Insight:** Regional preferences significantly dictate the "Second Line" battleground. US/EU are moving to ADCs faster; Asia retains caution due to toxicity profiles.

## Topic 3: The Financial Toxicity of Combinations
**Dr. James L., Payer Advisor / Oncologist (UK):**
> "We are looking at combinations like ADC + IO or ADC + PARP. The science is sound, but the cost is astronomical. Over $30k/month. Without a massive OS survival advantage (not just 2 months PFS), these won't get reimbursed in single-payer systems."

**Ms. Patricia D., Patient Advocate:**
> "Patients are forced to choose between groceries and co-pays. The 'Patient Support Programs' are fragmented. We need a single point of entry for financial navigation."

**Insight:** Market Access barriers are shifting from "formulary inclusion" to "patient out-of-pocket feasibility".

## Topic 4: Emerging Threats (PROTACs vs SERDs)
**Dr. Michael B., Early Phase Trialist (USA):**
> "I’ve put 20 patients on PROTAC trials. The lack of bradycardia and ocular issues (seen in SERDs/SERMs) is a relief. If Vepdegestrant hits its PFS endpoints, the oral SERD market is dead on arrival."

**Insight:** The "best-in-class" race is far from over. Commercial strategy should scenario-plan for a PROTAC takeover in 2026.

## Topic 5: Unmet Needs in TNBC
**Dr. Amara S., Oncologist (India/Global perspective):**
> "Sacituzumab is great, but access is zero in LMICs (Low-Middle Income Countries). And even in the West, once a patient progresses on Sacituzumab AND immunotherapy... we have nothing. We are recycling chemo. We need novel targets in TNBC desperately."

**Insight:** The "Post-ADC" TNBC setting is a blue-ocean opportunity for drug development.
