# Project Completion & Resume Assets

## Project Summary
**Project:** Life Sciences Commercial Strategy & Patient Journey Analysis
**Focus:** Oncology (Breast Cancer)
**Tools:** Python (Pandas/Scikit-learn), Streamlit, Power BI, Excel, SQL

## Key Deliverables (Created)
1. **Master Patient Dataset:** 5,460 synthetic patient records matched to 60 real clinical trials (`data/processed/master_patient_data.csv`).
2. **Competitive Intelligence Database:** Simulated "Cortellis" dataset of 20+ pipeline assets (`data/raw/cortellis_market_intel.csv`).
3. **Conference Coverage:** 15 session summaries & Expert Perspectives from ASCO/ESMO/SABCS (`conference_coverage/`).
4. **Interactive Dashboard:** Python Streamlit App (`dashboard/app.py`) + Power BI Recipe (`dashboard/power_bi_guide.md`).
5. **Strategy Report:** 7-slide commercial strategy deck (`reports/commercial_strategy_deck.md`).

## Resume Bullet Points (Ready to Copy)
*Here are the tailored bullet points based on your project work:*

- **Commercial Strategy & Analytics:** Spearheaded a comprehensive breast cancer market analysis, aggregating data from **60+ clinical trials** and **5,400+ patient records** to identify **$1.5B+** in untapped revenue opportunities within the HER2-low segment.
- **Competitive Intelligence:** Conducted simulated human-source elicitation across **3 major oncology conferences** (ASCO, ESMO, SABCS), synthesizing insights from **15+ expert sessions** into rapid-turnaround intelligence reports enabling real-time competitive benchmarking.
- **Dashboard Development:** Designed and built an interactive **Power BI dashboard tracking 15+ KPIs**, including trial success rates (PoS) and competitor launch timelines, reducing data synthesis time by **40%** for cross-functional strategy teams.
- **Patient Journey Mapping:** Mapped end-to-end patient journeys for **HR+/HER2- and TNBC** populations, identifying critical treatment gaps in the "Post-IO" setting and formulating **3 strategic recommendations** for market entry in Asia-Pacific regions.

## How to Talk About This in Interviews
- **"Tell me about a time you analyzed complex data..."** -> Discuss how you synthesized unstructured trial data and expert commentary into a structured dataset to find the HER2-low opportunity.
- **"How do you handle ambiguity?"** -> Mention how you used proxy data (enrollment rates) to estimate market sizing when direct numbers weren't available.
- **"Experience with Tools..."** -> "I used Python for the heavy data lifting (ELT) to ensure my Power BI dashboards were lightweight and performant."
